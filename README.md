Eagle library for the Raspberry Pi Pico board based on 2021-01-21 datasheet. 
Symbol based on pinout and footprint based on mechanical dimensions.

There should be two basic versions/packages: One with direct contact via castellated holes and one with headers.

I also made versions without PTH for the 3 debug pins at the bottom as well as a version without those 3 PTH and without holes for screws for more flexibility.
